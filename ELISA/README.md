The source plate contains three rows of samples, 25 uL of which are transferred to the output plate in triplicate (source row 1 to output row 1,2,3). 25 uL of standards are transferred (again in triplicate) to rows 10,11,12 of the output plate. Finally, 100 uL of liquid from the trough (antibody, etc) is applied to every well in the output plate.
