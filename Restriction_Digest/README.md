### [Single Enzyme Restriction Digest](se_restriction_digest.json)
Sets up reactions for a single enzyme, single sample restriction digest. The DNA, 10X Buffer, water and enzyme are all combined, and then a 1 hour wait period is initiated for incubating the enzyme at its optimal temperature, before Stop Buffer is added to stop the reaction.
