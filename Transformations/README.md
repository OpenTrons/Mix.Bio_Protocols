# Transformations

### [E. coli Heat Shock Transformation](heat_shock.json)
This protocol uses 50 uL competent cells, 2 uL plasmid DNA and 200 uL Luria Broth (LB). The DNA is first added to the cells, and then they are incubated for 30 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then, the entire solution is transferred to a new tube on the heat block and ‘heat shocked’ for exactly 60 seconds. The solution is then returned to the cold block for 5 minutes, before adding the LB. The tube is then removed from the robot and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius on a shaker for two hours before being plated.

### [4 Tube E. coli Heat Shock Transformation](4tube_heat_shock.json)
This protocol sets up 4 transformations of 50 uL competent cells, 2 uL plasmid DNA and 200 uL Luria Broth (LB) each. The DNA is added to each tube of cells, and then all four are incubated for 30 minutes at 4 degrees Celsius. Then, the entire solution in the first tube of cells in transferred to a new tube on the heat block and 'heat shocked' for exactly 60 seconds, and then returned to the cold block. The second tube is transferred, heat shocked and returned, and then the third and the fourth. All four tubes are incubated for 5 minutes on the cold block (starting from when the first tube of cells is returned to the cold block), and then the LB is added to each tube. The tubes are then removed from the robot and incubated at 37 degrees Celsius on a shaker for two hours before being plated.
